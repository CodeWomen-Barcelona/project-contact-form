# Project Contact Form

### The goal of this project is to practice working with forms

We will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React

**Basic functionality:** we want the user to be able to fill in their data and a message. For this purpose, the contact form will have fields for name, email and message.

1. Track your code with Git by using git init in the terminal
1. Create a function component called Form with input fields for name, email and message, plus a submit button

## Please note:
If you want to download a project on your local machine, do not fork it but clone the repo locally, on your computer. After that, create a new repo in your own GitHub account *with exactly the same project name*, and link the local repo to the remote repo in your GitHub account (see below). Why should you clone and not fork? It will show the project as **your own project** and not a fork of someone else's project. You can use it as a project for your portfolio.

You can connect a local project to a new, empty GitHub repo [as follows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line). We can do this together during a CodeWomen coding session: it is very good to know this so that you can start a project locally and afterwards link it with a remote GitHub repo.

If you clone the project without forking it, you will have to change the 'remote origin' repository after cloning. Check the remote of your local project using `git remote -v`. You will probably see:  
`origin  https://github.com/CodeWomen-Barcelona/some-codewomen-project.git (fetch)`  
`origin  https://github.com/CodeWomen-Barcelona/some-codewomen-project.git (push)`

To link your local project to your own GitHub repo, you need to change the remote origin. Have a look at this article: https://devconnected.com/how-to-change-git-remote-origin/. With `git remote -v` you can again check if remote origin has been reset and now shows the name of your GitHub account.

PS: if you work for a company that has a corporate social responsibility policy and wants to support women in tech, then here is the link to the [fundraising overview of MigraCode](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zs-Mmi39bcjVw2U-iEQWSHSjkb-EmET-j1WB2oJF45Q/edit#gid=0).
